# Poor Man's Music

Desktop music streaming application, built with [electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

It works erectly like Spotify: 

* Search for a song, an album or an artist 
* Select a song 
* Play
* ???
* Don't pay a single dime

The application will try to fetch a cover art for every song you start to play.

#### Todo

List of things that would be nice to have:

- [] When last song is played, load more songs (JS)
- [] Have a dynamic typehead (instead of poor static) (JS & APIs)
- [] Better typehead style (CSS & JS)
- [] Better `audio` player style (CSS)
- [] Create user playlist (database)
- [] Download MP3 files locally (fileSystem)
- [] Serve local MP3 file if found (fileSystem)
